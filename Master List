Language and axis labels in the visualizations must be accessible to a broad audience. Make sure that everything is simple and to the point. 
Your grandma should be able to understand it.

Titles cannot be over two lines (no more than 75 characters)

Tables need to be in separate page, portrait landscape orientation. Cannot be sideways
  - Need a short, one-line title in bold text
  - Symbols are defined below the table with additional descriptive material
    - All have to be double-spaced
    
Legends should begin with a brief title for the whole figure and continue with a short description of each panel and the symbols used
  - Should not contain any details about research methods
  - Need to be fewer than 300 words each
  
Figures should be simple and easy to understand
  - Cannot have more than one panel unless the visualizations are logically connected to each other
  - Standard sizes: 90 mm (single column) and 180 mm (double column) 
  - First letter needs to be capitalized then everything else needs to be undercase
  - Units should have a single space between number and unit
    - Thousands should be separated by commas
  - Text explaining or clarifying symbols should be included in the legend and not the axis
  - Should be incorporated with the text in a word or PDF
